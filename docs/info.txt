LangGraph is a framework for building stateful AI workflows using large language models.
It enables dynamic routing, multi-step reasoning, and tool integration.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines document retrieval with language models
to produce grounded and factual responses.

 
Java: Programming Language, Platform, and Technology 
Java as a Programming Language: 
• Java allows writing programs. 
Platform: 
• A software or hardware environment in which a program runs. 
• C compiler converts Unicode to bit code; Java compiler converts Unicode 
to byte code. 
Java Virtual Machine (JVM): 
• JVM converts byte code into bit code via an interpreter. 
• JVM is platform-specific: Windows JVM for Windows, Linux JVM for 
Linux, etc. 
Translation Software: 
• Compiler: Converts the whole program at once and produces a file. 
• Interpreter: Converts the program line by line without producing a file. 
Platform Dependency: 
• C: Platform-dependent. 
• Java: Platform-independent; Java programs can run on any platform due 
to the JVM. 
Java API and JRE: 
• Java API: Interface between applications and programming language. 
• JRE: Contains JVM and Java API. 
• JDK: Java Development Kit, includes JRE. The latest version is JDK 21. 
History: 
• Developed in 1995 by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Ed Frank, Chris 
Warth, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). 
• Slogan: “Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”. 
 
 
Identifiers 
Definition: 
• Identifiers are used to name variables, methods, classes, interfaces, 
packages, etc. 
Rules: 
1. Formed using letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), underscore (_), and dollar 
sign ($). 
2. Must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. 
3. No length limit. 
4. No special symbols other than underscore(_) and dollar sign($). 
5. No white space characters. 
Examples: 
• Valid: demo, Demo, DEMO, Demo2, version$2, version_2, _5_, _$2, 
$_2 
• Invalid: 2ndDemo, version#2, version-2, 5_$ 
 
Keywords 
Definition: 
• Reserved words in the Java language. 
Examples: 
• int, char, float, double, if, else, while, for, do, private, protected, public, 
static, final, void, assert, enum, class, interface, package. 
Notes: 
• Keywords must be in lowercase. 
• strictfp (JDK 1.2), assert (JDK 1.4), enum (JDK 1.5). 
• const and goto are not in use. 
• Keywords cannot be used as identifiers. 
 
Literals 
Definition: 
• Fixed value representations in source code. 
Categories: 
1. Integer Literals: 5, 9, 13, 467, 0, -2, -98, -987 
2. Floating Point Literals: 2.46, 0.08, -2.46, -999.3566 
3. Character Literals: 'a', 'x', 'A', 'Z', 'c' 
4. String Literals: "a", "hi", "hello", "welcome" 
5. Boolean Literals: true, false 
6. Object Literal: null 
Notes: 
• true, false, and null are not keywords and cannot be used as identifiers. 
 
Data Types 
Definition: 
• Determines the value a variable can hold and the operations on variables. 
Categories: 
1. Primitive Data Types: Predefined types named by keywords. 
o Integers: byte, short, int, long 
o Floating Points: float, double 
o Characters: char 
o Boolean: boolean 
2. Reference Data Types: Arrays, Strings, Classes, Interfaces, etc. 
 
 
 
 
Variables 
Definition: 
• Containers that hold data. 
Declaration: 
• Syntax: DataType Variable; 
• Example: int x; 
Assignment: 
• Syntax: Variable = Literal; 
• Example: x = 10; 
 
Initialization: 
• Syntax: DataType Variable = Literal; 
• Example: int x = 10; 
 
Notes: 
• Long literals must be suffixed with l or L. 
• Float literals must be suffixed with f or F. 
• ASCII Code: Digits start at 48, capital letters at 65, and small letters at 
97. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Type Conversions in Java 
Boolean Type: 
• Cannot be converted to or from other types. 
Implicit Conversions (Widening Conversions): 
• System performs these automatically. 
• Total: 19 
o byte: to short, int, long, float, double (5) 
o short: to int, long, float, double (4) 
o int: to long, float, double (3) 
o long: to float, double (2) 
o float: to double (1) 
o char: to int, long, float, double (4) 
Explicit Conversions (Narrowing Conversions): 
• Must be done by the programmer. 
• Total: 23 
o byte: to char (1) 
o short: to byte, char (2) 
o int: to byte, short, char (3) 
o long: to byte, short, int, char (4) 
o float: to byte, short, int, long, char (5) 
o double: to byte, short, int, long, float, char (6) 
o char: to byte, short (2) 
Operations on Data: 
1. (byte, short, int, char) + (byte, short, int, 
char) => int 
2. (byte, short, int, long, char) + long => long 
3. (byte, short, int, long, float, char) + float => 
float 
4. (byte, short, int, long, float, double, char) + 
double => double 
• Note: Operations cannot be performed on boolean types. 
 
Source File Declaration Rules: 
1. Only one public class per source file. 
2. Any number of non-public classes allowed. 
3. If a public class is present, the file name must match the public class 
name. 
4. No naming restrictions if there is no public class. 
Java Program Structure: 
class Demo { 
    public static void main(String args[]) { 
       System.out.println("Welcome to Java First Program"); 
    } 
} 
String and System classes are part of the java.lang package, imported 
by default. 
 
Compilation and Execution: 
• Compilation: 
C:\>javac Demo.java 
o Generates .class file for each class in the source file. 
 
• Execution: 
C:\>java Demo 
o Only the class with the main() method can be used to execute the 
program. 
 
 
Java Operators 
Operators: Special symbols that operate on data, categorized by their 
operations. 
1) Arithmetic Operators 
• Addition (+): Adds values. 
• Subtraction (-): Subtracts values. 
• Multiplication (*): Multiplies values. 
• Division (/): Divides values, returns quotient. 
• Modulo (%): Divides values, returns remainder. 
2) Relational Operators 
• <: Less than 
• >: Greater than 
• <=: Less than or equal to 
• >=: Greater than or equal to 
• ==: Equals to 
• !=: Not equals to 
Returns boolean values. 
3) Logical Operators 
• &&: Logical AND 
• ||: Logical OR 
• !: Logical NOT 
Types of Operators 
1. Unary Operator: Operates on one operand (e.g., ++a, a--, !a). 
2. Binary Operator: Operates on two operands (e.g., a + b, a > b). 
3. Ternary Operator: Operates on three operands (e.g., condition ? expr1 : 
expr2). 
4) Increment & Decrement Operators 
• Increment (++): Increases value by 1. 
• Decrement (--): Decreases value by 1. 
5) Bitwise Operators 
• & : Bitwise AND 
• | : Bitwise OR 
• ^ : Bitwise XOR 
• << : Left Shift 
• >> : Right Shift 
• ~ : Bitwise NOT 
6) Assignment Operators 
• = : Normal assignment 
• += : Add and assign (a += b  →  a = a + b) 
• -= : Subtract and assign (a -= b  →  a = a - b) 
• *= : Multiply and assign (a *= b  →  a = a * b) 
• /= : Divide and assign (a /= b  →  a =  a / b) 
• %= : Modulo and assign (a %= b  →  a = a % b) 
• &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>= : Bitwise operations and assign 
7) Conditional Operator (?:) 
Used to express conditions. 
8) Unary Plus & Unary Minus Operators 
• + : Unary Plus (no effect, indicates positive value) 
• - : Unary Minus (negates the value) 
9) Other Operators 
• []  : Array access operator 
• () : Type cast operator 
• instanceof : Checks if an object is an instance of a class 
• . : Member selection operator 
• () : Method call operator 
Java Statements 
Java statements are categorized into three main types: 
1) Selection Statements 
• if Statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true. 
• if-else Statement: Executes one block of code if a condition is true and 
another if it is false. 
• if-else if-else Statement: Checks multiple conditions, executing 
corresponding blocks of code. 
• Nested if Statement: An if statement inside another if statement. 
• switch Statement: Selects one of many code blocks to be executed. 
2) Iteration Statements (Loops) 
• while loop: Repeats a block of code while a condition is true. 
• do-while loop: Executes a block of code once, and then repeats it while a 
condition is true. 
• for loop: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times. 
• Enhanced for loop (for-each): Iterates over elements of an array or a 
collection. 
• Nested loops: Loops within loops. 
3) Jump Statements 
• break Statement: Exits a loop or switch statement. 
• break LABEL Statement: Exits an outer loop. 
• continue Statement: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds 
with the next iteration. 
• continue LABEL Statement: Skips the current iteration of an outer loop. 
• return Statement: Exits from the current method and optionally returns a 
value. 
These structured statements allow for controlling the flow of execution in a Java 
program effectively.
